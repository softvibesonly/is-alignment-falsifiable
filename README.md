# Is Alignment Falsifiable?

This repository contains all the files for my extended abstract/note titled **"Is Alignment Falsifiable?"**  
It includes the latest drafts of the paper as well as R scripts and the graphics I made.

- **Paper drafts** include both Pages and PDF formats because the first drafts had significantly less content so I think it just works to upload the latest Pages doc here.
- **R scripts** were used in RStudio to generate the (super unrealistic) figure in the last section of the paper that tries to show what different pillars might be able to achieve jointly even if they all mostly overlap in coverage.
- **Figures** are just the pictures/outputs from the R script.
